    "# About the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify drivers of assessed home value for single family properties so that we can become a stronger competitor in the home-buying market by more accurately predicting home values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "We want to find the drivers of Zestimate logerror in an effort to maximize accuracy in predicting home values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Questions\n",
    "1. Does age contribute to home value?\n",
    "2. Is there any correlation between logerror and where a property is located?\n",
    "3. Can we use latitude and longitude to create meaningful clusters?\n",
    "4. Is there a relationship between logerror and home size?\n",
    "5. If we control for county, does logerror differ across yearbuilt?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Dictionary\n",
    "| Variable | Meaning |\n",

    "## The Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrangle\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function to acquire the necessary zillow data from the mySQL database.\n",
    "2. Define a function to clean the acquired zillow data.\n",
    "3. Define a function to split the cleaned zillow data.\n",
    "4. Define a function to scale the split zillow data.\n",
    "5. Define a function to combine the previous steps into a single function.\n",
    "6. Ensure all functions work properly and add them to wrangle.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore\n",
    "1. Ask a clear question.\n",
    "2. Develop null and alternative hypotheses for that question.\n",
    "3. Use visualizations and statistical tests to find answers.\n",
    "4. Clearly state the answer to the question and summarize findings.\n",
    "5. Repeat for a total of at least 4 questions.\n",
    "6. Explore clusters to potentially use as features for models.\n",
    "7. Summarize key findings, takeaways, and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "1. Select a metric to use for evaluating models and explain why that metric was chosen.\n",
    "2. Create and evaluate a baseline model.\n",
    "    - Find median value of target\n",
    "    - Set all predictions to that value\n",
    "    - Evaluate based on selected evaluation metric\n",
    "3. Develop four models.\n",
    "4. Evaluate all models on the train sample, note observations.\n",
    "5. Evaluate the top models on the validate sample, note observations.\n",
    "6. Evaluate the best performing model on the test sample, note observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliver\n",
    "1. Ensure final report notebook is thoroughly code commented.\n",
    "2. Ensure notebook contains enough Markdown cells to guide the reader through the report.\n",
    "3. Write a conclusion summary.\n",
    "4. Develop actionable recommendations.\n",
    "5. Suggest next steps for research and/or model improvement.\n",
    "6. Run final report notebook from beginning to be sure that there are no errors.\n",
    "7. Submit link to repository containing project files.\n",
    "8. Submit video of recorded presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Reproduce\n",
    "- In a local repository, create a .gitignore file and add env.py.\n",
    "- In that same repository, create an env.py file to store the hostname, username, and password that will be used to access the zillow mySQL database.\n",
    "- Clone this repository, making sure the .gitignore is successfully hiding the env.py file.\n",
    "- Run all cells in Report.ipynb.\n",
    "- To see our full, in-depth step-by-step thought process for this project, run all cells in the other Jupyter notebooks in this repository.\n",
